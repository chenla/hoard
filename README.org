This will become the core Hoard for the Chenla Institute.  A /hoard/
can hold pretty much anything, text, code, rulesets etc.  This
particular Hoard will be used for anything and everything that falls
outside of the Primer.

You may notice that the category for the hoard is /primer/.  It might
be more correct to say that the Primer is a subset of the Hoard, but
since the Institute's primary goal is to create the Primer and not the
Encyclopedia Gallactica it seemed a little less daunting to choose
primer for the name of the category.
