All human civilizations rely on a sort of cultural 'book', that is, on
the capacity to put information in storage in order to use it.  Before
Homer's day, the Greek cultural 'book' had been stored in oral
memory.  Discoveries and conclusions associated with the recent
deciphermenf of 'Linear B', facinating and fashionable though they
are, must not be allowed to obscure this essential fact.  Between Homer
and Plato, the method of storage began to alter, as the information
became alphabetised, and correspondingly the eye supplanted the ear as
the chief organ employed for this purpose.  The complete results of
literacy did not supervene in Greece until the ushering in of the
Hellenistic age, when conceptual thought achieved as it were fluency
and its vocabulary became more or less standardised.  Plato, living in
the midst of of this revolution, accounced it and became it's prophet.

In these projections, world population peaks at 9.22 billion
in 2075. Population therefore grows slightly beyond the level of 8.92
billion projected for 2050 in the 2002 Revision, on which these pro-
jections are based. However, after reaching its maximum, world
population declines slightly and then resumes increasing, slowly, to
reach a level of 8.97 billion by 2300, not much different from the
projected 2050 figure.

Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, the director of the Potsdam Institute for
Climate Impact Research in Germany, said that if the buildup of
greenhouse gases and its consequences pushed global temperatures 9
degrees Fahrenheit higher than today — well below the upper
temperature range that scientists project could occur from global
warming — Earth’s population would be devastated.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
“In a very cynical way, it’s a triumph for science because at last we
have stabilized something –- namely the estimates for the carrying
capacity of the planet, namely below 1 billion people,” said
Dr. Schellnhuber, who has advised German Chancellor Angela Merkel on
climate policy and is a visiting professor at Oxford.

The article mentions that Dr. Schellnhuber was not describing a
worst-case scenario, to shake people up.

This article scared the living crap out of a lot of people, including
me cite:holthaus:2017stop-scaring.  It raised a huge stink in
mainstream media who pretty much agreed that it wasn't as bad as
Wallace said, and that it's not productive to scare people.

As I write this, it's now five months since the article came out and I
tend to think he was right and that people have since pretty much gone
back to worrying about climate change without really doing anything
about it.  In fact, since then Trump has pulled out of the Paris
Climate Accord.

We published “The Uninhabitable Earth” on Sunday night, and the
response since has been extraordinary — both in volume (it is already
the most-read article in New York Magazine’s history) and in
kind. Within hours, the article spawned a fleet of commentary across
newspapers, magazines, blogs, and Twitter, much of which came from
climate scientists and the journalists who cover them.

Some of this conversation has been about the factual basis for various
claims that appear in the article. To address those questions, and to
give all readers more context for how the article was reported and
what further reading is available, we are publishing here a version of
the article filled with research annotations. They include quotations
from scientists I spoke with throughout the reporting process;
citations to scientific papers, articles, and books I drew from;
additional research provided by my colleague Julia Mead; and context
surrounding some of the more contested claims. Since the article was
published, we have made four corrections and adjustments, which are
noted in the annotations (as well as at the end of the original
version). They are all minor, and none affects the central project of
the story: to apply the best science we have today to the median and
high-end “business-as-usual” warming projections produced by the
U.N.’s “gold standard” Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

But the debate this article has kicked up is less about specific facts
than the article’s overarching conceit. Is it helpful, or
journalistically ethical, to explore the worst-case scenarios of
climate change, however unlikely they are? How much should a writer
contextualize scary possibilities with information about how probable
those outcomes are, however speculative those probabilities may be?
What are the risks of terrifying or depressing readers so much they
disengage from the issue, and what should a journalist make of those
risks?

Clearly, there is not sufficiently widespread appreciation of
the implications of putting back into the air a large fraction
of the carbon stored in the ground over epochs of geologic
time. Climate forcing due to these greenhouse gases would
dwarf the climate forcing for any time in the past several
hundred thousand years, when accurate records of atmospheric
composition are available from ice cores.

#+begin_quote
Global ecologiests point out that our planet is in fact a space
vehicle with a mushromming human populationand a balanced,
continuously recycling life-support system.  Because key elements of
this system are increasingly threatened by man's pollution activities,
we must develop an effective early-warning process.  Scientists must
be willing to involve themselves in this process by detecting and
publicizing forefeeable threats to the environment (13).  This is not
to suggest any lessened importance of long-term research on the causes
and effects of pollution.  Our focus here is simply on another
dimension of pollution: those impending problems which require
preventitive action now.

What are some of the functions required of the scientist in this
early-warning approach to a potential pollution situation?  First,
this approach involveds ferreting out and analyzing all pertinent data
that are availible /now/.  Frank Di Luzio, former Assistant Secretary
of the Interior for Water Pollution Control, stated the concept well
(14):

    ... al of us would like to know all of the facts about the
    problems we are dealing with.  Since we never will know all of the
    facts, we've got to do the best we can with the facts at hand. To
    a considerable extent we must forego the satisfaction of dealing
    with incontrovertible scientific data and be guided simply by
    facie evidene.

Next, the scientist must be willing to publicize his tentative
conclusions from the data, and his assessment of alternative managment
measures and the likely effects of each which these conclusions
suggest to him.  It is not enough to "let the facts speak for
themselves."  The scientist, as a trained and experienced specialist,
has an obligation to give society his professional interpretation of
those facts.  It  is also essential to the validity of the
decision-making process that he identity this as /his/--not
/the/--interpretation.  When scientists disagree in their
interpretations, they should discuss and analyze the sources of
disagreement, for the ultimate benefit of society.

I suspect that a majority of scientists are disquieted by at least
some aspects of the role outlined above.  It stipulated the unpleasant
necessity of going out on a shaky limb of tentative conclusions.  It
often involves a kind of limelight the scientist would rather avoid,
and it may involve him, at least peripherally in unaccustomed
controversy.  Nevertheless the scientist must face the fact that he is
not living in a different ecosystem, with critical problems, on a new
time scale that require new approaches.  Only the dedicated scientific
recluse can total ignore these new responsibilities.  The
early-warning approach requires that scientists all the shots as they
see them and remember that debate is central to scientific progress.
They should recognize that straddling the fence too long can produce
sterility, and that when one has reached the point of making all his
communications noncontroversial there is no further need for him to
communicate.

#+begin_quote
A democracy supposes people can consider views other than their
own. This was Aristotle’s notion in the Politics. He thought the
awareness of difference occurs only in cities, since the every city is
formed by synoikismos, a drawing together of different families and
tribes, of competing economic interests, of natives with foreigners.

“Difference” today seems about identity -- we think of race, gender,
or class. Aristotle’s meant something more by difference; he included
also the experience of doing different things, of acting in divergent
ways which do not neatly fit together. The mixture in a city of action
as well as identity is the foundation of its distinctive
politics. Aristotle’s hope was that when a person becomes accustomed
to a diverse, complex milieu he or she will cease reacting violently
when challenged by something strange or contrary. Instead, this
environment should create an outlook favourable to discussion of
differing views or conflicting interests. Almost all modern urban
planners subscribe to this Aristotelian principle. But if in the same
space different persons or activities are merely concentrated, but
each remains isolated and segregated, diversity loses its
force. Differences have to interact.

Classical urbanism imagines two kinds of spaces in which this
interaction could occur. One was the pnyx, an ampitheatre in which
citizens listed to debates and took collective decisions; the other
was the agora, the town square in which people were exposed to
difference in a more raw, unmediated form.
#+end_quote

The Pynx was a theatre where people gave speeches.  This required the
audience to focus and concentrate.  There were no mobile devices to
distract, so I would assume the only distraction would be the person
next to you trying to talk while the speaker was speaking.

The Agora was for personal interaction.  Surrounding the Agora were
temples and "buildings called stoas, the latter sheds with an open
side onto the agora."  Since stoa were open on one side to the Agora
you could see what was going on outside and vice versa.  I suppose
this worked a bit like cafes with tables on the street and tables
inside (like you see in the tropics) so that there is no wall or glass
separating the outside from the inside.  This differs from street
cafe's in temperate climates where tables outside are outside and
tables inside are inside.

#+begin_quote
Yet the most urgent social requirement for democratic deliberation
today is that people concentrate rather than “surf” social reality. It
is for this reason that I’ve come to believe that designers need to
pay attention to the architecture of theatres as possible political
spaces. Live theatre aims at concentrating the attention of those
within it. To achieve sustained attention, to commit people to one
another even when the going gets rough or becomes boring, to unpack
the meaning of arguments, all require a disciplinary space for the eye
and the voice.
#+end_quote

The role that physical architecture encourages or hinders social
interaction and participation in a democractic society is far more
important than many people believe.  Architecture is so bad today,
that many people have forgotten how important well designed public
spaces are because they don't have any experience in spaces that are
well designed.  

Today's emphasis on using online intermediaries to connect people with
each other doesn't work.  Democracy works best in person -- it doesn't
work well remotely.  This is why community size is so important -- a
community larger than 5,000 people begins to alienate people, which,
in turn results in stratification and the need for hierarchical
organization and structures.

The mixture of Pynx, Agora and Stoa are all equally important.

In a society of employees dominated by the marketing mentality, it is
inevitable that a personality market should arise. For in the great
shift from manual skills to the art of ‘handling’, selling and
servicing people, personal or even intimate traits of employees are
drawn into the sphere of exchange and become commodities in the labor
market…

Kindness and friendliness become aspects of personalized service or of
public relations of big firms, rationalized to further the sale of
something. With anonymous insincerity, the successful person thus
makes an instrument of his own appearance and personality…In the
formulas of ‘personnel experts’, men and women are to be shaped into
the ‘well rounded, acceptable, effective personality’ (to close the
deal or to make the sale)… the personality market, the most decisive
effect and symptom of the great salesroom, underlies the all pervasive
distrust and self-alienation so characteristic of metropolitan
people. Without common values and mutual trust, the cash nexus that
links one man to another in transient contact has been made subtle in
a dozen ways, and made to bite deeper into all areas of life and
relations People are required by the salesman ethic and convention to
pretend interest in others in order to manipulate them…Men are
estranged from one another as each secretly tries to make an
instrument of the other, and in time a full circle is made: one makes
an instrument of himself and is estranged from it also.

Perhaps the most interesting natural limit, however, is what might be
called our social channel capacity. The case for a social capacity has
been made, most persuasively, by the British anthropologist Robin
Dunbar. Dunbar begins with a simple observation. Primates — monkeys,
chimps, baboons, humans — have the biggest brains of all mam-
mals. More important, a specific part of the brain of humans and other
primates — the region known as the neocortex, which deals with complex
thought and reasoning— is huge by mammal standards. For years,
scientists have argued back and forth about why this is the case. One
theory is that our brains evolved because our primate ancestors began
to engage in more sophisticated food gathering: instead of just eating
grasses and leaves they began eating fruit, which takes more thinking
power. You travel much farther to find fruit than leaves, so you need
to be able to create mental maps. You have to worry about
ripeness. You have to peel parts away in order to eat the flesh of a
fruit, and so on. The problem with that theory is that if vou try to
match up brain size with eating patterns among primates, it doesn't
work. There are primate leaf-eaters with big brains and fruit-eaters
with smaller brains, just as there are primates with small cortexes
who travel great distances for their food and primates with big brains
who stay at home to eat, so the food argument is a dead end. So what
does correlate with brain size? The answer, Dunbar argues, is group
size. If you look at any species of primate — at every variety of
monkey and ape — the larger their neocortex is, the larger the average
size of the groups they live with.

Dunbar's argument is that brains evolve, they get big- ger, in order
to handle the complexities of larger social groups. If you belong to a
group of five people, Dunbar points out, vou have to keep track of ten
separate relation- ships: your relationships with the four others in
your circle and the six other two-way relationships between the
others. That's what it means to know everyone in the circle. You have
to understand the personal dynamics of the group, juggle different
personalities, keep people happy, manage the demands on your own time
and attention, and so on. If you belong to a group of twenty people,
however, there are now 190 two-way relationships to keep track of: 19
involv- ing yourself and 171 involving the rest of the group. That's a
fivefold increase in the size of the group, but a twentyfold increase
in the amount of information processing needed to "know" the other
members of the group. Even a relatively small increase in the size of
a group, in other words, creates a significant additional social and
intellectual burden.

Humans socialize in the largest groups of all primates because we are
the only animals with brains large enough to handle the complexities
of that social arrangement.  Dunbar has actually developed an
equation, which works for most primates, in which he plugs in what he
calls the neocortex ratio of a particular species — the size of the
neocortex relative to the size of the brain — and the equation spits
out the expected maximum group size of the ani- mal. If you plug in
the neocortex ratio for Homo sapiens, you get a group estimate of
147.8 — or roughly 150. "The figure of 150 seems to represent the
maximum number of individuals with whom we can have a genuinely social
relationship, the kind of relationship that goes with know- ing who
they are and how they relate to us. Putting it another way, it's the
number of people you would not feel embarrassed about joining
uninvited for a drink if you happened to bump into them in a bar."

Dunbar has combed through the anthropological literature and found
that the number 150 pops up again and again. For example, he looks at
21 different hunter- gatherer societies for which we have solid
historical evi- dence, from the Walbiri of Australia to the Tauade of
New Guinea to the Ammassalik of Greenland to the Ona of Tierra del
Fuego and found that the average number of people in their villages
was 148.4. The same pattern holds true for military
organization. "Over the years military planners have arrived at a rule
of thumb which dictates that functional fighting units cannot be
substantially larger than 200 men," Dunbar writes. "This, I suspect,
is not simply a matter of how the generals in the rear exercise
control and coordination, because companies have remained obdurately
stuck at this size despite all the advances in communications
technology since the first world war. Rather, it is as though the
planners have dis- covered, by trial and error over the centuries,
that it is hard to get more than this number of men sufficiently
familiar with each other so that they can work together as a func-
tional unit." It is still possible, of course, to run an army with
larger groups. But at a bigger size you have to impose complicated
hierarchies and rules and regulations and for- mal measures to try to
command loyalty and cohesion.  But below 150, Dunbar argues, it is
possible to achieve these same goals informally: "At this size, orders
can be implemented and unruly behavior controlled on the basis of
personal loyalties and direct man-to-man contacts.  With larger
groups, this becomes impossible."

Then there is the example of the religious group known as the
Hutterites, who for hundreds of years have lived in self-sufficient
agricultural colonies in Europe and, since the early twentieth
century, in North America. The Hutterites (who came out of the same
tradition as the Amish and the Mennonites) have a strict policy that
every time a colony approaches 150, they split it in two and start a
new one. "Keeping things under 150 just seems to be the best and most
efficient way to manage a group of people," Bill Gross, one of the
leaders of a Hutterite colony outside Spokane told me. "When things
get larger than that, people become strangers to one another." The
Hutterites, obvi- ously, didn't get this idea from contemporary
evolutionary psychology. They've been following the 150 rule for cen-
turies. But their rationale fits perfectly with Dunbar's theories. At
150, the Hutterites believe, something happens — something indefinable
but very real — that somehow changes the nature of community
overnight. "In smaller groups people are a lot closer. They're knit
together, which is very important if you want to be effective and
successful at community life," Gross said. "If you get too large, you
don't have enough work in common. You don't have enough things in
common, and then you start to become strangers and that close-knit
fellowship starts to get lost." Gross spoke from experience. He had
been in Hutterite colonies that had come near to that magic num- ber
and seen firsthand how things had changed. "What happens when you get
that big is that the group starts, just on its own, to form a sort of
clan." He made a gesture with his hands, as if to demonstrate
division. "You get two or three groups within the larger group. That
is something you really try to prevent, and when it happens it is a
good time to branch out."

Wilbert "Bill" Gore — the late founder of the company — was no more
influenced, of course, by the ideas of Robin Dunbar than the
Hutterites were. Like them, he seems to have stumbled on the principle
by trial and error.  "We found again and again that things get clumsy
at a hun- dred and fifty," he told an interviewer some years ago, so
150 employees per plant became the company goal. In the electronics
division of the company, that means that no plant was built larger
than 50,000 square feet, since there was almost no way to put many
more than 150 people in a building that size. "People used to ask me,
how do you do your long-term planning," Hen said. "And I'd say, that's
easy, we put a hundred and fifty parking spaces in the lot, and when
people start parking on the grass, we know it's time to buiid a new
plant." That new plant doesn't have to be far away. In Gore's home
state of Delaware, for instance, the company has three plants within
sight of each other. In fact, the company has fifteen plants within a
twelve-mile radius in Delaware and Maryland. The buildings only have
to be distinct enough to allow for an individual culture in
each. "We've found that a parking lot is a big gap between buildings,"
one longtime associate, Burt Chase, told me. "You've got to pick
yourself up and walk across the lot, and that's a big effort. That's
almost as much effort as it takes to get in your car and drive five
miles.  There's a lot of independence in just having a separate
building." As Gore has grown in recent years, the com- pany has
undergone an almost constant process of division and redivision. Other
companies would just keep adding additions to the main plant, or
extend a production line, or double shifts. Gore tries to split up
groups into smaller and smaller pieces. When I visited Gore, for
example, they had just divided their Gore-Tex apparel business into
two groups, in order to get under the 150 limit. The more
fashion-oriented consumer business of boots and backpacks and hiking
gear was going off on its own, leaving behind the institutional
business that makes Gore-Tex uniforms for firefighters and soldiers.

References Adam Smith's /pin factory/ thought experiment in /Wealth of
Nations/.  See Wealth of Nations, Book I Chapters 1-4 cite:smith:1977wealth.

#+begin_quote
The most potent method, short of automation, is the so-called
‘division of labour’ and the classical example is the pin factory
eulogised in Adam Smith’s /Wealth of Nations/. Here it is not a matter
of ordinary specialisation, which mankind has practiced from time
immemorial, but of dividing up every complete process of production
into minute parts, so that the final product can be produced at great
speed without anyone having had to contribute more than a totally
insignificant and, in most cases, unskilled movement of his limbs.
#+end_quote

Not sure but I think it was Scott who commented on the pin factory
thought experiment saying, what is the effect on a worker who's entire
life is spent fixing the heads on pins.

#+begin_quote
The Buddhist point of view takes the function of work to be at least
threefold: to give man a chance to utilise and develop his faculties; to
enable him to overcome his ego-centeredness by joining with other people
in a common task; and to bring forth the goods and services needed for a
becoming existence.
#+end_quote

The Buddhist function of work:
  - give a chance to use and develop skills/knowledge
  - overcome ego-centerdness by collaborating with others on common tasks.
  - create the goods and services for existence.

#+begin_quote
Again, the consequences that flow from this view are endless. To
organise work in such a manner that it becomes meaningless, boring,
stultifying, or nerve-racking for the worker would be little short of
criminal; it would indicate a greater concern with goods than with
people, an evil lack of compassion and a soul-destroying degree of
attachment to the most primitive side of this worldly existence.
#+end_quote

This is echoed repeatedly in /The Craftsman/
citenum:sennett:2008craftsman which stresses the connection between
the head and the hand and the need for work to be more than simply
production.  

#+begin_quote
Equally, to strive for leisure as an alternative to work
would be considered a complete misunderstanding of one of the basic
truths of human existence, namely that work and leisure are
complementary parts of the same living process and cannot be separated
without destroying the joy of work and the bliss of leisure.
#+end_quote

The alienation of the worker has taken away half of what a
fulfilled life is made of and filled that half with meaningless labor
that serves no purpose for the worker and serves no purpose for
society.  There is only production and consumption.  And if all you
have left is consumption, than leisure is the only pursuit left as
well, giving you time to consume.  



Adam Smith points out that a great deal of innovation and invention is
the result of workers who are trying to automate things to make their
lives easier.  

#+begin_quote
I shall only observe, therefore, that the invention of all those
machines by which labour is so much facilitated and abridged, seems to
have been originally owing to the division of labour. Men are much
more likely to discover easier and readier methods of attaining any
object, when the whole attention of their minds is directed towards
that single object, than when it is dissipated among a great variety
of things. But in consequence of the division of labour, the whole of
every man's attention comes naturally to be directed towards some one
very simple object. It is naturally to be expected, therefore, that
some one or other of those who are employed in each particular branch
of labour should soon find out easier and readier methods of
performing their own particular work, wherever the nature of it admits
of such improvement. A great part of the machines made use of in
those manufactures in which labour is most subdivided, were originally
the inventions of common workmen, who, being each of them employed in
some very simple operation, naturally turned their thoughts towards
finding out easier and readier methods of performing it. Whoever has
been much accustomed to visit such manufactures, must frequently have
been shewn very pretty machines, which were the inventions of such
workmen, in order to facilitate and quicken their own particular
part of the work. In the first fire-engines, a boy was constantly
employed to open and shut alternately the communication between the
boiler and the cylinder, according as the piston either ascended or
descended. One of those boys, who loved to play with his companions,
observed that, by tying a string from the handle of the valve which
opened this communication, to another part of the machine, the valve
would open and shut without his assistance, and leave him at liberty
to divert himself with his play-fellows. One of the greatest
improvements that has been made upon this machine, since it was first
invented, was in this manner the discovery of a boy who wanted to save
his own labour.

-- Wealth of Nations, Book I Chapters 1-4 cite:smith:1977wealth
#+end_quote

The problem with this is that modern workers are not allowed to do
this.  They are machine operators, and in that respect are thought of
and treated as machines.  You don't ask a machine for input or
creativity.  Taking /any/ level of control over the process of work,
no matter how small, from the worker not only dehumanizes the worker
but ensures that the process never improves from within, thus throwing
away a crucial means of gaining advantage over the competition.
Rather machinery is thought to be a product, which is used, not
tinkered with or extended or even fixed.

#+begin_quote
A man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of
employment to another. When he first begins the new work he is seldom
very keen and hearty; his mind, as they say, does not go to it, and
for some time he rather trifles than applies to good purpose. The
habit of sauntering and of indolent careless application, which is
naturally, or rather necessarily acquired by every country workman who
is obliged to change his work and his tools every half hour, and to
apply his hand in twenty different ways almost every day of his life,
renders him almost always slothful and lazy, and incapable of any
vigorous application even on the most pressing occasions.

#+begin_quote
The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple
operations, of which the effects are perhaps always the same, or very
nearly the same, has no occasion to exert his understanding or to
exercise his invention in finding out expedients for removing
difficulties which never occur. He naturally loses, therefore, the
habit of such exertion, and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant
as it is possible for a human creature to become. The torpor of his
mind renders him not only incapable of relishing or bearing a part in
any rational conversation, but of conceiving any generous, noble, or
tender sentiment, and consequently of forming any just judgment
concerning many even of the ordinary duties of private life. Of the
great and extensive interests of his country he is altogether
incapable of judging, and unless very particular pains have been taken
to render him otherwise, he is equally incapable of defending his
country in war. The uniformity of his stationary life naturally
corrupts the courage of his mind, and makes him regard with abhorrence
the irregular, uncertain, and adventurous life of a soldier. It
corrupts even the activity of his body, and renders him incapable of
exerting his strength with vigour and perseverance in any other
employment than that to which he has been bred. His dexterity at his
own particular trade seems, in this manner, to be acquired at the
expense of his intellectual, social, and martial virtues. But in every
improved and civilised society this is the state into which the
labouring poor, that is, the great body of the people, must
necessarily fall, unless government takes some pains to prevent it.

The answer to this is the government, not free markets as some would
have you believe today..

#+begin_quote
In some cases the state of the society necessarily places the greater
part of individuals in such situations as naturally form in them,
without any attention of government, almost all the abilities and
virtues which that state requires, or perhaps can admit of. In other
cases the state of the society does not place the part of individuals
in such situations, and some attention of government is necessary in
order to prevent the almost entire corruption and degeneracy of the
great body of the people.
