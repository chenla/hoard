All human civilizations rely on a sort of cultural 'book', that is, on
the capacity to put information in storage in order to use it.  Before
Homer's day, the Greek cultural 'book' had been stored in oral
memory.  Discoveries and conclusions associated with the recent
deciphermenf of 'Linear B', facinating and fashionable though they
are, must not be allowed to obscure this essential fact.  Between Homer
and Plato, the method of storage began to alter, as the information
became alphabetised, and correspondingly the eye supplanted the ear as
the chief organ employed for this purpose.  The complete results of
literacy did not supervene in Greece until the ushering in of the
Hellenistic age, when conceptual thought achieved as it were fluency
and its vocabulary became more or less standardised.  Plato, living in
the midst of of this revolution, accounced it and became it's prophet.

In these projections, world population peaks at 9.22 billion
in 2075. Population therefore grows slightly beyond the level of 8.92
billion projected for 2050 in the 2002 Revision, on which these pro-
jections are based. However, after reaching its maximum, world
population declines slightly and then resumes increasing, slowly, to
reach a level of 8.97 billion by 2300, not much different from the
projected 2050 figure.

Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, the director of the Potsdam Institute for
Climate Impact Research in Germany, said that if the buildup of
greenhouse gases and its consequences pushed global temperatures 9
degrees Fahrenheit higher than today — well below the upper
temperature range that scientists project could occur from global
warming — Earth’s population would be devastated.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
“In a very cynical way, it’s a triumph for science because at last we
have stabilized something –- namely the estimates for the carrying
capacity of the planet, namely below 1 billion people,” said
Dr. Schellnhuber, who has advised German Chancellor Angela Merkel on
climate policy and is a visiting professor at Oxford.

The article mentions that Dr. Schellnhuber was not describing a
worst-case scenario, to shake people up.

This article scared the living crap out of a lot of people, including
me cite:holthaus:2017stop-scaring.  It raised a huge stink in
mainstream media who pretty much agreed that it wasn't as bad as
Wallace said, and that it's not productive to scare people.

As I write this, it's now five months since the article came out and I
tend to think he was right and that people have since pretty much gone
back to worrying about climate change without really doing anything
about it.  In fact, since then Trump has pulled out of the Paris
Climate Accord.

We published “The Uninhabitable Earth” on Sunday night, and the
response since has been extraordinary — both in volume (it is already
the most-read article in New York Magazine’s history) and in
kind. Within hours, the article spawned a fleet of commentary across
newspapers, magazines, blogs, and Twitter, much of which came from
climate scientists and the journalists who cover them.

Some of this conversation has been about the factual basis for various
claims that appear in the article. To address those questions, and to
give all readers more context for how the article was reported and
what further reading is available, we are publishing here a version of
the article filled with research annotations. They include quotations
from scientists I spoke with throughout the reporting process;
citations to scientific papers, articles, and books I drew from;
additional research provided by my colleague Julia Mead; and context
surrounding some of the more contested claims. Since the article was
published, we have made four corrections and adjustments, which are
noted in the annotations (as well as at the end of the original
version). They are all minor, and none affects the central project of
the story: to apply the best science we have today to the median and
high-end “business-as-usual” warming projections produced by the
U.N.’s “gold standard” Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

But the debate this article has kicked up is less about specific facts
than the article’s overarching conceit. Is it helpful, or
journalistically ethical, to explore the worst-case scenarios of
climate change, however unlikely they are? How much should a writer
contextualize scary possibilities with information about how probable
those outcomes are, however speculative those probabilities may be?
What are the risks of terrifying or depressing readers so much they
disengage from the issue, and what should a journalist make of those
risks?

Clearly, there is not sufficiently widespread appreciation of
the implications of putting back into the air a large fraction
of the carbon stored in the ground over epochs of geologic
time. Climate forcing due to these greenhouse gases would
dwarf the climate forcing for any time in the past several
hundred thousand years, when accurate records of atmospheric
composition are available from ice cores.

#+begin_quote
Global ecologiests point out that our planet is in fact a space
vehicle with a mushromming human populationand a balanced,
continuously recycling life-support system.  Because key elements of
this system are increasingly threatened by man's pollution activities,
we must develop an effective early-warning process.  Scientists must
be willing to involve themselves in this process by detecting and
publicizing forefeeable threats to the environment (13).  This is not
to suggest any lessened importance of long-term research on the causes
and effects of pollution.  Our focus here is simply on another
dimension of pollution: those impending problems which require
preventitive action now.

What are some of the functions required of the scientist in this
early-warning approach to a potential pollution situation?  First,
this approach involveds ferreting out and analyzing all pertinent data
that are availible /now/.  Frank Di Luzio, former Assistant Secretary
of the Interior for Water Pollution Control, stated the concept well
(14):

    ... al of us would like to know all of the facts about the
    problems we are dealing with.  Since we never will know all of the
    facts, we've got to do the best we can with the facts at hand. To
    a considerable extent we must forego the satisfaction of dealing
    with incontrovertible scientific data and be guided simply by
    facie evidene.

Next, the scientist must be willing to publicize his tentative
conclusions from the data, and his assessment of alternative managment
measures and the likely effects of each which these conclusions
suggest to him.  It is not enough to "let the facts speak for
themselves."  The scientist, as a trained and experienced specialist,
has an obligation to give society his professional interpretation of
those facts.  It  is also essential to the validity of the
decision-making process that he identity this as /his/--not
/the/--interpretation.  When scientists disagree in their
interpretations, they should discuss and analyze the sources of
disagreement, for the ultimate benefit of society.

I suspect that a majority of scientists are disquieted by at least
some aspects of the role outlined above.  It stipulated the unpleasant
necessity of going out on a shaky limb of tentative conclusions.  It
often involves a kind of limelight the scientist would rather avoid,
and it may involve him, at least peripherally in unaccustomed
controversy.  Nevertheless the scientist must face the fact that he is
not living in a different ecosystem, with critical problems, on a new
time scale that require new approaches.  Only the dedicated scientific
recluse can total ignore these new responsibilities.  The
early-warning approach requires that scientists all the shots as they
see them and remember that debate is central to scientific progress.
They should recognize that straddling the fence too long can produce
sterility, and that when one has reached the point of making all his
communications noncontroversial there is no further need for him to
communicate.
