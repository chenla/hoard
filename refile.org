** Scope


/Entity classes/ describe entites that represent groups of things in
contrast with /entity types/ which describe entities that are mutually
exclusive atoms Most records are described by both an /entity class/
that they are part of and an /entity type/ which they are an instance
of.

 group

    `----> class | type
#+end_src

In this example the /civilization entity group/ can be seen as a
hierarchy of classes each of which is a a group of other items that
are each specific type of entities.

#+begin_src ascii
civilization                        (concept)
    \
     `--> primer                    (expression)
             \
              `--> deploy           (manifestation)
                      \
                       `--> project (instance)
